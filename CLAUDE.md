# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the **machina-meta** workspace.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Architecture Analysis Protocol

**Before proposing ANY architectural change or creating extensive documentation (>200 lines):**

### 1. Verify First, Propose Second
- **Read the actual source code** - Don't assume, verify
- **Map current architecture** - Document what EXISTS, not what you think exists
- **Trace data flows** - Follow from entry point to implementation
- **Check existing APIs/endpoints** - Verify what's already exposed vs internal

### 2. State Assumptions Explicitly
- **List all assumptions** you're making about the system
- **Mark each as VERIFIED or UNVERIFIED**
- **Ask user to confirm BEFORE building on unverified assumptions**

Example format:
```
ASSUMPTIONS:
❌ UNVERIFIED: Component X is exposed via HTTP
❌ UNVERIFIED: Proposed solution Y addresses problem Z
→ Ask: "Let me verify: Is X currently accessible via HTTP, or only internal?"
```

### 3. Watch for Red Flags (Validate Immediately)

Stop and validate if you notice:
- 🚩 **Wrapper around wrapper** (converting A→B→A) - likely architectural misunderstanding
- 🚩 **Unclear value proposition** - can't articulate why the change is needed
- 🚩 **Haven't seen the code** for what you're proposing to modify
- 🚩 **Building something that should already exist** - ask why it doesn't
- 🚩 **>1 hour of analysis without user validation** - checkpoint every 30-60 min

### 4. Incremental Validation Checkpoints

After major discovery phases, STOP and validate:
```
✋ CHECKPOINT: "Here's what I found about current architecture: [summary]
Does this match your understanding before I proceed?"

[WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION]
```

### 5. Quick Validation Checklist

Before extensive analysis:
```
□ Read actual source code?
□ Verified assumptions with evidence (code/docs)?
□ Stated assumptions explicitly to user?
□ Asked clarifying questions about the goal?
□ Checked for circular logic in proposal?
□ User validated direction?
```

**If ANY box unchecked → STOP and validate first**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Machina-Git Skill Requirement

**When the user requests ANY git operation (commit, push, pull, status, diff, add, checkout, branch, tag, log, show, etc.):**

1. **IMMEDIATELY invoke the machina-git skill** using the Skill tool
2. **DO NOT run git commands via Bash first**
3. **DO NOT bypass the skill for "simple" operations** like `git status` or `git diff`
4. **If you're about to type a bash git command, STOP** and invoke `/machina-git` instead

**This is a hard requirement for workspace safety with submodules.**

- The machina-git skill enforces working directory safety, prevents repo corruption
- Running git commands directly via Bash bypasses critical safety checks
- Each of the 5 repositories has independent git history - wrong directory = corrupted state
- The skill provides secret scanning, commit readiness evaluation, and atomic commit guidance

**Pattern:**
```
User: "commit these changes"
Assistant: [Immediately invokes Skill tool with skill: "machina-git"]

NOT:
User: "commit these changes"
Assistant: [Runs bash git commands directly] ❌ WRONG
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Rules

This workspace uses **git submodules**, which means multiple independent git repositories exist within the directory structure. Follow these rules carefully to avoid corrupting repository state.

### 1. Working Directory Safety

**ALWAYS verify and explicitly cd into the target repository before running ANY git command.**

- **NEVER assume** you are in the correct working directory
- **ALWAYS use explicit `cd` commands** before git operations, even if you think you're already there
- Running git commands in the wrong directory can corrupt repository state
- This is especially critical with submodules where each repo has independent git history

**Required pattern:**
```bash
# CORRECT - Always cd explicitly before git commands
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git status
git commit -m "message"

# WRONG - Never assume you're in the right place
# (assuming you're already in repos/dem2)
git status  # Dangerous! Could be in wrong repo
```

**Why this matters:**
- Each submodule is an independent git repository
- The workspace root (machina-meta) is ALSO a git repository
- Running git commands in the wrong repo can corrupt state or create confusing commits
- Path confusion can lead to committing in the wrong repo

### 2. Push Policy

**NEVER push to git repositories unless explicitly requested or confirmed by the user.**

- Always commit changes locally
- **DO NOT** run `git push` automatically
- **DO NOT** push as part of workflows or multi-step operations
- Ask the user first: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"
- Only push if the user explicitly says "yes", "push", "push it", or gives clear confirmation

### 3. Commit Message Policy

**NEVER add Claude Code attribution or co-authorship credits to commit messages.**

- **DO NOT** include `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
- **DO NOT** include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` or similar lines
- Write clear, concise commit messages following conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- Follow the existing repository's commit message style

### Applies To

These rules apply to:
- machina-meta repository (workspace root)
- All submodule repositories (repos/dem2, repos/dem2-webui, repos/dem2-infra, repos/medical-catalog)
- Any git command: status, commit, push, pull, checkout, branch, log, diff, tag, etc.

## Workspace Overview

**machina-meta** is the unified workspace for the MachinaMed (dem2) platform. It coordinates multiple git repositories using git submodules, providing integrated development and deployment workflows.

### Managed Repositories

| Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **dem2** | MachinaMed backend - medical AI platform | Python 3.13, FastAPI, uv, Neo4j, PostgreSQL |
| **dem2-webui** | MachinaMed frontend | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, pnpm |
| **dem2-infra** | Infrastructure management | Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Helm |
| **medical-catalog** | Biomarker/medical catalog service | Python, FastAPI, Qdrant |
| **gcloud-admin** | DevOps tooling container for GKE cluster operations | Docker, gcloud, kubectl, helm, k9s, argocd |

### Nix Development Environment

The workspace uses Nix for reproducible development tooling:

- **`nix/`**: Nix package sources managed by [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv)
  - `sources.json`: Pinned versions of tools (ArgoCD CLI, etc.)
  - Add packages: `niv add <package>`
  - Update packages: `niv update <package>`

- **`shell.nix`**: Development shell environment
  - Auto-loads when entering directory (if using direnv/nix-shell)
  - Provides: `argocd`, `gh`, `just`, and other CLI tools
  - Enter manually: `nix-shell`

### gcloud-admin DevOps Container

The **gcloud-admin** directory contains a DevOps container for GKE cluster operations:

**Purpose**: Provides consistent kubectl/gcloud/helm access without local installation
- Runs in Docker with all Google Cloud tools pre-installed
- Stores credentials in Docker volumes (persistent across rebuilds)
- Used for cluster access, ArgoCD operations, and deployment management

**Common operations**:
```bash
cd gcloud-admin

# Authenticate and setup (first time)
just setup-nonprod   # Setup nonprod cluster access

# Run kubectl commands
just kubectl get pods -n argocd
just kubectl get applications -n argocd

# Run other tools
just helm list -A
just k9s             # Interactive cluster UI
```

**Integration with machina-meta**:
- The gcloud-admin justfile is imported as a module in the root justfile
- List gcloud-admin commands: `just --list gcloud-admin`
- Run commands using: `just gcloud-admin::<command>`
- Examples:
  - `just gcloud-admin::kubectl get pods -n argocd`
  - `just gcloud-admin::helm list -A`
  - `just gcloud-admin::k9s`
  - `just gcloud-admin::setup-nonprod` (first-time setup)
- See `gcloud-admin/CLAUDE.md` for complete documentation
- Credentials persist in Docker volume `gcp-config-volume`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta.git
cd machina-meta

# Bootstrap (first time)
just bootstrap

# Check status
just status
just branches
just dev-status

# Start development (choose one mode):

# Option 1: Production mode (full stack in containers)
just dev-up

# Option 2: Hot-reload mode (databases only, run apps manually)
just dev-up-hot
# Then in separate terminals:
cd repos/dem2 && just run
cd repos/dem2-webui && pnpm dev
cd repos/medical-catalog && just run
```

## Working with the Workspace

### When to Use Workspace Commands

**Use workspace-level commands** (from machina-meta root) for:
- Multi-repo feature development
- Checking status across all services
- Coordinated releases and tagging
- Managing preview environments
- Cross-repo branch operations

**Use individual repo commands** (cd into repos/*) for:
- Service-specific development
- Running unit tests
- Service-specific debugging
- Committing changes

### Common Development Patterns

#### Multi-Repo Feature Development

```bash
# From machina-meta root
just repo-checkout feature/my-feature

# Work in individual repos
cd repos/dem2
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: backend changes"
git push origin feature/my-feature

cd ../dem2-webui
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: frontend changes"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Check status across all
cd ../..
just repo-status
just repo-branches
```

#### Checking Workspace State

```bash
just repo-status    # Git status across all repos
just repo-diff      # Show diffs across all repos
just repo-branches  # Show current branches
just repo-log 5     # Show last 5 commits from each repo
just dev-status     # Check all dev servers (API, frontend, databases)
```

#### Syncing Repositories

```bash
just repo-sync      # Update all submodules to latest
just repo-pull      # Pull latest in each repo
```

#### Development Stack

```bash
just dev-status   # Check what's running
just dev-up       # Start full stack (production mode - containers)
just dev-up-hot   # Start databases only (hot-reload mode)
just dev-down     # Stop all services
```

**Two Development Modes:**
- **Production Mode** (`just dev-up`): Full stack in Docker containers (frontend + backend + medical-catalog + databases)
- **Hot-Reload Mode** (`just dev-up-hot`): Databases only, run apps with `just run` and `pnpm dev` for instant code changes

## Development Setup by Service

### dem2 (Backend)

```bash
cd repos/dem2

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start databases
just dev-env-up -d

# Run migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head
just graph-upgrade-head

# Load fixtures
just load-all-fixtures

# Start server
just run  # http://localhost:8000
```

**Key commands:**
- `just check` - Format + lint + typecheck
- `just test` - Run unit tests
- `uv run mypy` - Type checking
- `just graph-generate` - Regenerate graph models from schema.yml

### dem2-webui (Frontend)

```bash
cd repos/dem2-webui

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate API types (backend must be running)
pnpm generate

# Start dev server
pnpm dev  # http://localhost:3000

# Lint and format
pnpm check
```

### medical-catalog (Catalog Service)

```bash
cd repos/medical-catalog

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start service
just run
```

### dem2-infra (Infrastructure)

```bash
cd repos/dem2-infra

# Preview environments
git checkout -b preview/my-test
# Push to trigger deployment

# Check current deployments
kubectl get deployments -n tusdi-dev
```

## Architecture Overview

│   (Frontend)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ HTTP/WebSocket

         │
         ├──► PostgreSQL (5432)  - User data, sessions
         ├──► Neo4j (7474,7687)  - Graph data
         ├──► Redis (6379)       - Pub/sub, cache
         ├──► Qdrant (6333)      - Vector embeddings
         └──► medical-catalog    - Biomarker data
```

### Frontend-Backend Integration

**API Contract:**
- OpenAPI spec: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`
- Type generation: `cd repos/dem2-webui && pnpm generate`
- Manual types: `repos/dem2-webui/src/types/`

**Authentication:**
- Dual JWT token system (access + refresh)
- HTTP-only cookies
- Auto-refresh on 401
- Session polling every 60s

**Real-Time (WebSocket):**
- Endpoint: `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/medical-data-engine/events`
- Redis pub/sub backend
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff

**Patient Context Headers:**
- `X-Patient-Context-ID` - Current patient
- `X-Patient-Latitude` / `X-Patient-Longitude` - Location
- `X-Client-Timezone` - Datetime handling

## Git Submodules

Each directory in `repos/` is an independent git repository tracked as a submodule.

### Submodule Workflow

```bash
# Make changes in a submodule
cd repos/dem2
git checkout dev
git pull
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "changes"
git push

# Update parent workspace to track new commit
cd ../..
git add repos/dem2
git commit -m "Update dem2 to latest dev"
git push
```

### Submodule Tips

- Changes are tracked in the submodule's own repository
- The workspace tracks which commit each submodule points to
- Use `just sync-all` to update all submodules to latest
- Each submodule can be on different branches

## Preview Environments

Create preview environments for testing. See [docs/DEVOPS.md](docs/DEVOPS.md) for comprehensive guide on preview environments, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

```bash
# From machina-meta root
just preview my-feature

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/monitor-preview.sh my-feature

# This will:
# 1. Tag dem2 and dem2-webui with preview-my-feature
# 2. Create/checkout preview/my-feature branch in dem2-infra
# 3. Push changes trigger ArgoCD deployment
```

## Development Services

The development stack is organized into 5 categories:

### Frontend
| Service | Port | Type | Health Check |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| Frontend | 3000 | Next.js | http://localhost:3000 |

### Backend
| Service | Port | Type | Health Check |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| Backend API | 8000 | FastAPI | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Medical Catalog | 8001 | FastAPI | http://localhost:8001/health |

### Database
| Service | Port | Type | Health Check |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Relational | `psql -h localhost -U postgres` |
| Neo4j | 7474, 7687 | Graph | http://localhost:7474 |

### Infrastructure
| Service | Port | Type | Health Check |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| Redis | 6379 | Cache/Pub-Sub | `redis-cli ping` |
| Qdrant | 6333 | Vector Search | http://localhost:6333 |

### Dev Tools
| Service | Port | Type | Health Check |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| RedisInsight | 5540 | Redis UI | http://localhost:5540 |

## Integration with External Tools

### gcloud-admin (DevOps Container)

The gcloud-admin container (located outside this workspace) can mount machina-meta:

```bash
# From gcloud-admin directory
just workspace-status    # Status from inside container
just workspace-branches  # Branches from inside container
just workspace-log       # Logs from inside container
```

The container mounts machina-meta at `/workspace/` for unified DevOps operations.

## Common Patterns

### Python Projects (dem2, medical-catalog)

- Package manager: `uv`
- Task runner: `just` (justfile)
- Linting: `ruff`
- Type checking: `mypy`
- Config: `dynaconf` with `config.toml`
- Testing: `pytest`

### TypeScript/JavaScript (dem2-webui)

- Package manager: `pnpm`
- Linting/formatting: `biome`
- Framework: Next.js 15 with App Router
- State: React Context + hooks
- API client: Wretch

### Infrastructure (dem2-infra)

- Orchestration: Kubernetes (GKE)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- Registry: Google Artifact Registry
- Manifests: Kustomize

## Environment Configuration

- **Secrets**: `.env` files (never commit)
- **Config**: `config.toml` files (can commit)
- **Template**: `.env.example` in each repo

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values for each service.

## Git Workflow

- **Main branches**: `dev` (active development), `main` (production)
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description` or `TICKET-123-description`
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- **Preview envs**: `git tag -f preview-{id} && git push origin preview-{id} --force`

## PROBLEMS.md - Issue Tracking

The `PROBLEMS.md` file tracks known problems, issues, and challenges that may not yet have solutions.

**Relationship to TODO.md**:
- Problems are observations that need investigation before becoming actionable tasks
- When a solution is identified, create a TODO item and link it to the problem
- When the TODO is completed, mark the problem as SOLVED

**Problem States**:
- `[OPEN]` - Needs investigation to understand root cause
- `[INVESTIGATING]` - Active analysis or proposed solutions exist
- `[SOLVED]` - Completed TODO items address this problem
- `[WONT_FIX]` - Acknowledged but intentionally not addressed

**Severity Levels**:
- `CRITICAL` - Blocking production or core functionality
- `HIGH` - Significant impact on users or development
- `MEDIUM` - Notable issue worth tracking
- `LOW` - Minor annoyance or edge case

## TODO.md - Task Tracking

The `TODO.md` file tracks planned work, improvements, and technical debt.

**Structure**: Organized as a tree following the workspace hierarchy:
- `Workspace - Multi-Repo Features` - Cross-repository work
- `Workspace - Infrastructure & CI/CD` - Workspace-level infrastructure
- `Workspace - Documentation & Tooling` - Workspace-level docs and tools
- Repository-specific sections (see individual repos)

**Task States**:
- `[PROPOSED]` - Under consideration, not yet approved
- `[STARTED]` - Approved and in progress
- `[REVIEW]` - Work completed, awaiting user review and approval before marking DONE
- `[DONE]` - Completed and approved by user
- `[REVERTED]` - Was DONE but later rolled back (e.g., git revert)
- `[CANCELLED]` - Removed from scope with documented reason

**Task Format**:
Each task entry includes:
- **State**: One of PROPOSED, STARTED, DONE, REVERTED, or CANCELLED
- **Impact**: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW - estimate of value/importance
- **Added**: Date task was created
- **Completed**: Date task was finished (for DONE items)
- **Subtasks**: Checkmarked list of completed work items

**Impact Levels**:
- `HIGH` - Critical for core functionality, blocking other work, or significant user value
- `MEDIUM` - Important improvement, enhances quality or developer experience
- `LOW` - Nice to have, minor improvement, or future consideration

**Workflow**:
- Add new tasks under the appropriate category with `[PROPOSED]` or `[STARTED]` state
- Include impact estimate for prioritization
- When completing work, mark as `[DONE]` with completion date
- **Important**: DONE items should reference a relevant git commit that implements the change
- Update continuously as work progresses
- Include file paths for implementation context where helpful

**Task Journal Requirements**:
- **All changes to a task MUST be journaled within the task entry itself**
- Adding steps: Add with `- [ ]` checkbox
- Completing steps: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` with completion note
- **Removing steps**: Do NOT delete silently. Mark as cancelled with reason:
  - `- [CANCELLED] Step description - Reason for cancellation (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- Changing scope: Add a note explaining the change
- This preserves the full history of task evolution

**Commit Requirements**:
- **Every git commit MUST have an associated TODO.md item**
- Before making a commit, ensure there is a corresponding task entry
- If no task exists, create one (even retroactively) before or with the commit
- Mark the task as DONE with completion date when work is finished
- Trivial fixes (typos, formatting) may share a parent task or use a catch-all maintenance task

**Immediate Commit Requirement**:
- **Changes to PROBLEMS.md or TODO.md MUST be committed to git immediately after modification**
- Do not batch changes to these files with other work
- These files track project state and must be version-controlled as soon as they are updated

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Task State Changes Require User Approval**:
- **NEVER mark a task as [DONE] or a problem as [SOLVED] without explicit user approval**
- When work is completed, change the task state to [REVIEW]
- The [REVIEW] state indicates: "Work completed, awaiting user review and approval before marking DONE"
- Wait for the user to explicitly approve ("mark it done", "looks good", "approved", etc.)
- Only change from [REVIEW] to [DONE] after receiving explicit user approval
- This applies to ALL repositories: machina-meta, dem2, dem2-webui, medical-catalog, dem2-infra
- For problems: use [INVESTIGATING] until user confirms the solution is acceptable, then [SOLVED]

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Documentation Maintenance

### AGENTS.md - Keep Up to Date

**[docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md)** documents MachinaMed's Google ADK agent architecture based on verified source code.

**This file MUST be updated whenever agent code changes:**

- Adding/removing agents (update agent types list and count)
- Modifying agent configs (update routing rules, model selection, etc.)
- Changing agent composition patterns (update architecture diagrams/examples)
- Updating SafeAgentTool or other tool wrappers (update tool patterns section)
- Modifying MachinaMedState (update state management section)
- Changing callback patterns (update callback system section)

**Location of agent code**: `repos/dem2/services/medical-agent/src/machina/medical_agent/agents/`

**How to update**:
1. Identify which sections of AGENTS.md are affected by code changes
2. Re-examine the changed source files
3. Update AGENTS.md with verified information (mark as VERIFIED)
4. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom
5. Create TODO.md task for the documentation update
6. Commit both files together

**Never let AGENTS.md drift from actual implementation - it's a living reference document.**

### DATAFLOW.md - System Data Flow Architecture

**[docs/DATAFLOW.md](docs/DATAFLOW.md)** documents MachinaMed's complete data flow architecture with Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams.

**Purpose**: Comprehensive visual and textual documentation of how data flows through the entire system, from user input through services, agents, databases, and back to the user.

**Key Sections**:
- System architecture overview
- Service-level communication (frontend ↔ backend ↔ medical-catalog)
- Frontend-backend HTTP/WebSocket flows
- Agent processing (tool calling patterns, internal Python calls)
- **Document processing pipeline** (upload → extraction → reconciliation → graph storage)
- Database layer (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, Qdrant)
- Container networking
- Performance characteristics

**This file MUST be updated whenever system architecture changes:**
- Adding/removing services or databases
- Changing API endpoints or communication patterns
- Modifying agent tool calling mechanisms
- **Updating document processing pipeline** (extraction agents, normalization rules, catalog integration)
- Changing database schemas or graph patterns
- Adding new data flows or integration points
- Modifying authentication/authorization flows

**Regeneration Process**:
See **[docs/DATAFLOW_README.md](docs/DATAFLOW_README.md)** for detailed instructions on how to regenerate this documentation when the system changes. The process is designed to be repeatable and verification-based.

**How to update**:
1. Identify which data flows are affected by code changes
2. Use the Explore agent to research actual implementation
3. Verify all flows by reading source code (never assume)
4. Update Mermaid diagrams in DATAFLOW.md
5. Update corresponding Graphviz .dot files
6. Update version number and "Last Updated" date
7. Create TODO.md task for the documentation update
8. Commit all updated files together

**Never let DATAFLOW.md drift from actual implementation - it's a living reference document.**

### LLM.md - LLM Integration and Prompt Engineering

**[docs/LLM.md](docs/LLM.md)** - Comprehensive reference for LLM provider integrations and prompt engineering.

**Use this document when**:
- Modifying agent prompts (config.yml files)
- Adding/changing LLM providers or models
- Debugging prompt-related issues
- Understanding prompt template system
- Model selection or cost optimization questions

**Update when**: Agent prompts change, new LLM providers added, model configurations modified, or prompt engineering patterns updated.

See **[docs/LLM_README.md](docs/LLM_README.md)** for regeneration instructions.

### Citation System - Verifiable Documentation

**[docs/CITATIONS.md](docs/CITATIONS.md)** documents the citation system for AGENTS.md, DATAFLOW.md, and all architecture documentation.

**Core Principle**: Every factual claim MUST be provable via an executable command (yq/jq/grep) that returns exit code 0.

**When updating documentation, ALWAYS refer to [docs/CITATIONS.md](docs/CITATIONS.md) for**:
- Tool selection guide (yq for YAML, jq for JSON, grep for code)
- Citation format requirements
- Verification protocols (test ALL citations before committing)
- Update procedures

### Diagram Styling Standards

**When creating or updating any diagrams, schematics, or visual documents, refer to [docs/DIAGRAMS.md](docs/DIAGRAMS.md)** for required styling standards and best practices.

**All diagrams use Graphviz .dot files with SVG output**:
1. Create `.dot` file with proper styling and standard entity definitions
2. Render to SVG: `dot -Tsvg diagram.dot -o diagram.svg`
3. Reference in markdown: `![Description](diagram.svg)`
4. Validate consistency: `./scripts/validate_diagram_consistency.py`
5. Commit both `.dot` source and `.svg` output

See [docs/DIAGRAMS.md](docs/DIAGRAMS.md) for complete workflow, standard entity definitions, and examples.

## Workspace Principles

1. **Submodules maintain independence** - Each repo has its own git history
2. **Workspace provides coordination** - Unified commands for cross-repo operations
3. **Service isolation** - Services can be developed and tested independently
4. **Integrated deployment** - Preview environments coordinate across services

## Quick Reference

### Workspace Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `just bootstrap` | Initial setup |
| `just repo-status` | Git status all repos |
| `just repo-diff` | Show diffs all repos |
| `just repo-branches` | Show current branches |
| `just repo-checkout <branch>` | Checkout across all repos |
| `just checkout-repo <repo> <branch>` | Checkout in specific repo |
| `just dev-status` | Check all services |
| `just dev-up` | Start full stack (production mode) |
| `just dev-up-hot` | Start databases only (hot-reload mode) |
| `just dev-down` | Stop all services |
| `just repo-check` | Lint/type check all |
| `just repo-test` | Test all repos |
| `just repo-log <n>` | Show commits |

### Service Commands

| Action | dem2 | dem2-webui |
|--------|------|------------|
| Install | `uv sync` | `pnpm install` |
| Run | `just run` | `pnpm dev` |
| Check | `just check` | `pnpm check` |
| Test | `just test` | `pnpm test` |

## Troubleshooting

**Submodules out of sync:**
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
just repo-sync
```

**Databases not starting:**
```bash
cd repos/dem2
just dev-env-down
just dev-env-up -d
```

**Frontend types out of date:**
```bash
cd repos/dem2-webui
pnpm generate  # Backend must be running
```

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
just dev-status  # Check what's running
# Kill conflicting processes or change ports in configs
```
