# Machina Git Skill

Git workflow assistance specifically designed for the machina-meta workspace with its submodule architecture.

**This skill governs ALL git operations** including status checks, commits, pushes, and multi-repo workflows.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANDATORY SKILL USAGE

**DO NOT BYPASS THIS SKILL. EVER.**

**100% of git commits MUST use this skill. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

If you attempt to use the Bash tool directly for ANY git operation (status, diff, add, commit, push, etc.), you are violating critical safety protocols for this workspace.

**Before ANY git operation:**
1. **STOP** - Do not use Bash tool
2. **INVOKE** - Call `Skill` tool with `skill: "machina-git"`
3. **LET THE SKILL HANDLE IT** - The skill will execute the proper workflow

**Why this is mandatory:**
- machina-meta has 5 independent git repositories (submodules)
- Running git commands in wrong directory corrupts repository state
- This skill enforces: working directory safety, security scanning, commit readiness evaluation, atomic commits
- Bypassing this skill has caused production issues in the past

**User expectations:**
- When user says "commit this" or any git-related request → IMMEDIATELY invoke machina-git skill
- Do not perform git operations yourself
- Do not "help" by running git commands via Bash tool

**This is a hard requirement. Treat any attempt to bypass this skill as a critical error.**

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates for ALL git-related requests:
- "commit these changes"
- "commit with message"
- "prepare a commit"
- "stage and commit"
- "check git status"
- "show git diff"
- "push to remote"
- "check repo status"
- "help me with git"
- "draft a commit message"
- Any git command or git workflow question

## Skill Activation Notice

**CRITICAL: Whenever this skill is employed, ALWAYS emit this message to the user first:**

```
NOTE: Using machina-git skill for this operation.
```

This informs the user that strict git safety protocols are being applied.

## Core Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

### 1. Working Directory Safety (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS explicitly cd into the target repository before ANY git command.**

```bash
# CORRECT - Always cd explicitly
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git status
git commit -m "message"

# WRONG - Never assume current directory
git status  # Dangerous in submodule environment
```

**Why this matters:**
- machina-meta has 5 independent git repositories (root + 4 submodules)
- Each submodule has independent git history
- Running git commands in wrong repo corrupts state
- Path confusion causes commits in wrong repo

**Repository Paths:**
- Workspace root: `/home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta`
- Backend: `/home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2`
- Frontend: `/home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-webui`
- Infrastructure: `/home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-infra`
- Catalog: `/home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/medical-catalog`

### 2. Push Policy (CRITICAL)

**NEVER push to git repositories automatically.**

- Always commit changes locally first
- **DO NOT** run `git push` without explicit user confirmation
- **DO NOT** push as part of automated workflows
- Ask: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"
- Only push if user explicitly confirms ("yes", "push", "push it")

### 3. Commit Message Policy (CRITICAL)

**NEVER add Claude Code attribution or co-authorship credits.**

- **DO NOT** include `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]`
- **DO NOT** include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Write clean, concise conventional commit messages
- Follow repository's existing commit style

### 4. Atomic Commits (CRITICAL)

**Unrelated changes should be committed separately and atomically whenever possible.**

- Each commit should represent a single logical change
- Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit (e.g., adding a feature + updating documentation for a different feature)
- Separate concerns even when working on multiple things simultaneously
- Makes git history cleaner and easier to review/revert

**Examples:**

✅ **Good - Atomic commits:**
```bash
# Commit 1: Add new skill
git add .claude/skills/machina-git/
git commit -m "feat: add machina-git custom skill"

# Commit 2: Separate unrelated change
git add .claude/skills/kubernetes/
git commit -m "feat: add kubernetes skill for K8s operations"
```

❌ **Bad - Mixed concerns:**
```bash
# BAD - Two unrelated features in one commit
git add .claude/skills/machina-git/ .claude/skills/kubernetes/
git commit -m "feat: add machina-git and kubernetes skills"
```

**When to separate commits:**
- Different features or bug fixes
- Different subsystems or components
- Documentation updates for different topics
- Dependency updates vs feature changes
- Refactoring vs new functionality

**When commits can be combined:**
- Changes are tightly coupled (e.g., API + corresponding tests)
- Documentation for the code being changed
- Multiple files implementing one logical feature

## Multi-Repo Status Checks

When checking status across multiple repositories, always show which repo you're checking:

```bash
echo "=== Checking machina-meta (workspace root) ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta
git status

echo "=== Checking repos/dem2 (backend) ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git status

echo "=== Checking repos/dem2-webui (frontend) ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-webui
git status

echo "=== Checking repos/dem2-infra (infrastructure) ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-infra
git status

echo "=== Checking repos/medical-catalog (catalog service) ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/medical-catalog
git status
```

**Alternative:** Use workspace-level just commands:
```bash
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta
just repo-status    # Git status across all repos
just repo-branches  # Show current branches
just repo-diff      # Show diffs across all repos
```

## Workflow Pattern

### Step 0: Emit Skill Activation Notice

**ALWAYS start by informing the user:**
```
NOTE: Using machina-git skill for this operation.
```

### Step 1: Identify Target Repository

When user requests a git operation, first identify which repository:

```
User mentions: "commit the backend changes"
→ Target: repos/dem2

User mentions: "commit CLAUDE.md"
→ Target: workspace root (machina-meta)

User mentions: "commit the frontend"
→ Target: repos/dem2-webui

User mentions: "check status of all repos"
→ Target: all repositories (use just repo-status or iterate)
```

If unclear, ask: "Which repository should I work with?"

### Step 2: Explicit Directory Change

Always show and execute the `cd` command:

```bash
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
```

### Step 3: Review Current State

```bash
git status
git diff
```

Show the user what will be committed. Ask if this looks correct.

### Step 4: Stage Changes

**ALWAYS stage specific files explicitly. NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`.**

```bash
# CORRECT - Stage specific files
git add path/to/file1.py path/to/file2.py

# WRONG - Never use these
git add .   # BAD
git add -A  # BAD
```

⚠️ **NEVER stage sensitive files:**
- `.env` files containing secrets
- Credential files (`.pem`, `.key`, service account JSON, etc.)
- Configuration files with sensitive data

⚠️ **Why no `git add -A` or `git add .`:**
- Can accidentally stage unintended files
- May include sensitive files (.env, credentials)
- Less explicit and harder to review
- Always specify exactly what should be committed

### Step 4.5: Security Scan Staged Changes (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS scan staged diff for secrets before committing. STOP if detected.**

```bash
# Check staged diff for potential secrets
git diff --cached
```

**Scan the output for these patterns (case-insensitive):**
- API keys: `api_key`, `apikey`, `api-key`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, etc.
- Secret keys: `secret_key`, `secret`, `SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, etc.
- Tokens: `token`, `auth_token`, `access_token`, `bearer`, `jwt`, etc.
- Passwords: `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `pass =`, etc.
- Private keys: `PRIVATE KEY`, `-----BEGIN`, `.pem`, `.key` file contents
- Database URLs: `postgres://`, `mysql://`, `mongodb://` with credentials
- OAuth credentials: `client_secret`, `client_id` with actual values
- Service account keys: `private_key_id`, `"type": "service_account"`
- Authentication headers: `Authorization:`, `X-API-Key:`

**Pattern indicators to look for:**
```
+    API_KEY = "sk-..."
+    SECRET_KEY = "abc123..."
+    password = "my-secret-pass"
+    token: "eyJhbGciOiJ..."
+    private_key: "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"
+    DATABASE_URL = "postgres://user:password@host/db"
```

**If ANY secrets are detected:**
1. **STOP immediately** - Do not proceed with commit
2. Alert the user: "⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: Potential secrets detected in staged changes!"
3. Show the detected lines
4. Ask: "These look like secrets. Should I unstage these files?"
5. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

**Example:**
```bash
# After git diff --cached, if you see:
+    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyC..."
+    secret_token = "abc123xyz..."

# STOP and alert:
⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: Potential secrets detected in staged changes!

Lines 45-46 in config.py:
+    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSyC..."
+    secret_token = "abc123xyz..."

These look like secrets. Should I unstage these files?
```

### Step 4.6: Evaluate Commit Readiness (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS perform this evaluation before crafting commit message. Present findings to user.**

Analyze the staged changes and answer these questions:

**1. Impact/Value Assessment:**
```
What is the impact or value of this commit?
- [ ] Fixes critical bug affecting users
- [ ] Adds new feature with user benefit
- [ ] Improves performance or reliability
- [ ] Refactors code for maintainability
- [ ] Updates documentation
- [ ] Other: ___

Estimated Impact: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation]
```

**2. Testing Status:**
```
Has testing been performed?
- [ ] Unit tests run and passing
- [ ] Integration tests run and passing
- [ ] Manual testing performed
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed
- [ ] No testing performed (explain why)

Testing Status: [PASSED / PARTIAL / NONE]
Details: [What was tested, results]
```

**3. Static Analysis Status:**
```
Has static analysis been performed?
- [ ] Linting (ruff check) - passed
- [ ] Type checking (mypy) - passed
- [ ] Code formatting (ruff format) - applied
- [ ] Security scanning - passed
- [ ] Other checks: ___

Static Analysis: [PASSED / PARTIAL / NONE]
Issues: [Any warnings or errors to address]
```

**4. Problem Solved:**
```
What problem does this solve?
- Root cause: [What was broken or why change is needed]
- Symptoms: [How problem manifested]
- Solution: [How this change addresses it]
- References: [TODO.md, PROBLEMS.md, Jira tickets]
```

**5. Risk Assessment:**
```
What is the potential risk in pushing this commit?
- [ ] Breaking changes to API/contracts
- [ ] Database migration required
- [ ] Dependency changes
- [ ] Performance impact
- [ ] Security implications
- [ ] Affects critical path
- [ ] Low risk / no breaking changes

Risk Level: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
Mitigation: [How to reduce risk, rollback plan]
```

**Example Evaluation:**

```
=== COMMIT READINESS EVALUATION ===

1. Impact/Value:
   ✅ Fixes critical bug: symptoms and conditions lost during document processing
   Estimated Impact: HIGH
   Reasoning: Core functionality broken, affects all document processing

2. Testing Status:
   ✅ Unit tests added and passing (test_prepare_resource_data.py)
   ✅ Manual testing with sample documents confirmed fix
   Testing Status: PASSED
   Details: Verified symptoms/conditions now preserved in graph

3. Static Analysis:
   ✅ Linting: ruff check passed
   ✅ Type checking: mypy passed
   ✅ Formatting: ruff format applied
   Static Analysis: PASSED

4. Problem Solved:
   Root cause: Duplicate PreparedResourceData assignment overwriting data
   Symptoms: Symptoms and conditions missing from graph after processing
   Solution: Removed duplicate assignment, preserved all resource types
   References: TODO.md "Fix biomarker extraction bug" [DONE]
              PROBLEMS.md "Missing symptoms in graph" [SOLVED]

5. Risk Assessment:
   ✅ No breaking changes to API
   ✅ No database migration required
   ✅ Backwards compatible
   Risk Level: LOW
   Mitigation: Changes isolated to single method, well-tested

=== RECOMMENDATION: READY TO COMMIT ===
```

**If evaluation reveals issues:**
- Missing tests → Run tests or document why not needed
- Static analysis failures → Fix issues before committing
- High risk → Discuss mitigation with user
- Unclear problem → Clarify what this solves

**Present evaluation to user and ask: "Does this evaluation look correct? Should I proceed with the commit?"**

### Step 5: Craft Commit Message

Use conventional commit format with structured body for significant changes.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or fixing tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `build` - Build system changes

**Scope (optional but recommended):**
- Component, module, or area affected
- Examples: `api`, `agents`, `docproc`, `auth`, `infra`, `scripts`

**Summary Line:**
- Concise summary in imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at the end
- Lowercase first letter
- Max 72 characters
- For phased work, prefix with "Phase N - " (e.g., "feat: Phase 2 - Implement automatic session management")

**When to Add Multi-Line Body:**

Add detailed body for commits that:
- Fix bugs (explain root cause and impact)
- Implement significant features (explain approach and benefits)
- Make architectural changes (explain reasoning)
- Resolve TODO.md tasks or PROBLEMS.md issues (reference them)
- Are part of multi-step/phased work (reference related commits)
- Have measurable impact (include metrics)

**Body Structure Sections (use as applicable):**

1. **Root Cause / Problem** (for fixes):
   - Why the change is needed
   - What was broken

2. **Changes / Solution Implemented**:
   - What was done (bullet points)
   - Key implementation details

3. **Testing Results** (when tested):
   - Use ✅ / ❌ checkmarks for test outcomes
   - Include metrics when available

4. **Impact / Benefits**:
   - User impact or developer experience improvement
   - Quantifiable metrics when possible:
     - "Time savings: 15+ minutes per run"
     - "Error reduction: ~95%"
     - "Accuracy: 97.1%"

5. **Files Modified** (for complex changes):
   - List key files changed with brief description

6. **Related** (critical - always include when applicable):
   - TODO.md references: "Related: TODO.md task marked as DONE"
   - PROBLEMS.md references: "Related: PROBLEMS.md [SOLVED]"
   - Jira tickets: "Resolves: DEM-123" or "Related: DEM-456"
   - Related commits: "Follows: abc1234 (Phase 1 diagnostics)"
   - Preview environments: "Deployed to: preview-90"

**Examples:**

Simple change:
```
feat(api): add patient biomarker reconciliation endpoint
```

Bug fix with detail:
```
fix(docproc): disable aggressive parenthetical stripping in biomarker names

Disable Maxim's _PARENTHETICAL_SUFFIX_PATTERN regex that was incorrectly
stripping integral parentheticals like "Lp(a)" → "Lp".

Changes:
- Add _ENABLE_PARENTHETICAL_STRIPPING flag (default: False)
- Conditionally apply parenthetical stripping only when flag is True
- Rely on LLM extraction prompt for abbreviation handling

Impact:
- Lp(a) now correctly preserved with parentheses
- Extraction accuracy improved from 63.8% to 65.2% (44→45 exact matches)
- No regressions introduced

Testing:
- Verified Lp(a) extracted as exact match: "<15 mg/dL"
- Generated comparison reports confirming fix

Related:
- Issue discovered: 2025-12-19 (David Beal)
- Root cause: Maxim's Boston Heart processor (2025-12-11)
```

Feature with phasing:
```
feat: Phase 2 - Implement automatic session management for med-agent

Completed Phase 2: Investigated session API and implemented automatic session creation.

Root Cause:
- SessionNotFoundError: API requires pre-existing sessions
- Original query_agent() generated UUID without creating session

Solution Implemented:
1. Added create_session() function
2. Added list_sessions() function
3. Updated query_agent() to auto-create sessions

Testing Results:
✅ Manual session creation successful
✅ Query with manual session: HTTP 200
✅ Automatic session creation successful

Related: TODO.md "Fix med-agent endpoint" [DONE]
Related: PROBLEMS.md "Med-agent endpoint" [SOLVED]
Follows: 2859d1ca (Phase 1 diagnostics)
```

Documentation update:
```
docs: add comprehensive document processing monitoring guide

- Created DOCUMENT_PROCESSING.md with complete API reference
- Tested shell helper functions (curl_api.sh)
- Pipeline architecture and processing stages
- Common troubleshooting workflows

All example commands tested against running backend (2024-12-30)
```

### Step 6: Execute Commit

**Only proceed if:**
- Security scan passed (no secrets detected)
- Commit readiness evaluation looks good
- User confirmed to proceed

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

**For multi-line commits:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(api): add patient biomarker reconciliation endpoint

- Implement POST /api/v1/biomarkers/reconcile
- Add validation for incoming biomarker data
- Integrate with medical-catalog service for normalization
- Add comprehensive error handling
EOF
)"
```

### Step 7: Verify Commit

```bash
git log -1 --stat
```

Show the user the commit that was created and confirm it matches expectations.

### Step 8: Push Confirmation (If Needed)

**Only if user explicitly requests pushing:**

1. Verify commit is correct
2. Ask: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. If confirmed, execute:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Multi-Line Commit Messages

For complex changes, use multi-line format with structured sections.

**Template:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

[Root Cause / Problem:]
Brief explanation of why this change is needed

[Changes / Solution Implemented:]
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

[Testing Results:]
✅ Test case 1 passed
✅ Test case 2 passed
❌ Known limitation (if any)

[Impact / Benefits:]
- Quantifiable metrics when available
- User or developer experience improvements

[Files Modified:]
- file1.py: description
- file2.py: description

[Related:]
- TODO.md reference
- PROBLEMS.md reference
- Jira ticket
- Related commit hash
EOF
)"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Section headers (e.g., "Changes:", "Testing Results:") are optional labels for clarity
- Use only the sections that are relevant to your commit
- Always include "Related:" section when the commit resolves/references TODO.md, PROBLEMS.md, or Jira tickets
- Quantify impact when possible ("Time savings: 15+ minutes", "Accuracy: 97.1%")

**Example - Bug Fix:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(medical-data-engine): remove duplicate PreparedResourceData assignment

The duplicate assignment was overwriting prepared after setting biomarkers,
symptoms, and conditions, causing symptoms and conditions to be lost.

Before (buggy):
  prepared.biomarkers = data.biomarkers
  prepared.symptoms = data.basic_resources.symptoms
  prepared.conditions = data.basic_resources.conditions
  prepared = PreparedResourceData(biomarkers=data.biomarkers)  # ❌ Overwrites!

After (fixed):
  prepared.biomarkers = data.biomarkers
  prepared.symptoms = data.basic_resources.symptoms  # ✅ Preserved
  prepared.conditions = data.basic_resources.conditions  # ✅ Preserved

Impact: Symptoms and conditions are now correctly included in prepared data.

```

**Example - Feature with Phasing:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: Phase 2 - Implement automatic session management for med-agent

Completed Phase 2: Investigated session API and implemented automatic session creation.

Root Cause:
- SessionNotFoundError: API requires pre-existing sessions
- Original query_agent() generated UUID without creating session

Solution Implemented:
1. Added create_session() function:
   - POST /api/v1/med-agent/users/sessions
   - Requires X-Patient-Context-ID header

2. Added list_sessions() function:
   - GET /api/v1/med-agent/users/sessions

3. Updated query_agent() function:
   - Automatically creates session if session_id not provided
   - Enables conversation continuity across queries

Testing Results:
✅ Manual session creation successful
✅ Query with manual session: HTTP 200
✅ Automatic session creation successful
✅ Query with auto-created session: HTTP 200

Files Modified:
- scripts/curl_api.sh: Added session management functions
- TODO.md: Marked task as DONE
- PROBLEMS.md: Marked issue as SOLVED

The med-agent endpoint is now fully functional. Users can query processed
medical documents without manual session management.

## Working with Submodules

### Committing in a Submodule

```bash
# Step 1: cd into submodule
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2

# Step 2: Make changes, stage, commit
git add services/medical-agent/src/machina/medical_agent/agents/config.yml
git commit -m "feat(agents): update medical agent prompt template"

# Step 3: Push to submodule's remote (if confirmed)
git push origin dev
```

### Updating Parent Workspace to Track Submodule Change

After committing in a submodule, the parent workspace needs to track the new commit:

```bash
# Step 1: cd back to workspace root
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta

# Step 2: Stage the submodule update
git add repos/dem2

# Step 3: Commit in parent workspace
git commit -m "chore: update dem2 submodule to latest dev"

# Step 4: Push parent workspace (if confirmed)
git push
```

## Safety Checklist

Before executing any git operation:

- [ ] **Emit skill activation notice to user first**
- [ ] Explicitly cd into target repository
- [ ] Show full absolute path in cd command
- [ ] Review git status and git diff (for commits)
- [ ] Confirm changes with user (for commits)
- [ ] Ensure changes are related and atomic (separate unrelated changes)
- [ ] Stage specific files only (NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`)
- [ ] Verify no sensitive files are being staged (.env, credentials, keys)
- [ ] **Run security scan on staged diff (git diff --cached) - STOP if secrets detected**
- [ ] **Perform commit readiness evaluation (impact, testing, static analysis, problem, risk)**
- [ ] **Present evaluation to user and get confirmation to proceed**
- [ ] Craft conventional commit message (no Claude attribution)
- [ ] Include relevant sections in body (Root Cause, Changes, Testing, Impact, Related)
- [ ] Reference TODO.md, PROBLEMS.md, or Jira tickets in "Related:" section
- [ ] Execute commit with heredoc for multi-line
- [ ] Verify commit with git log -1 --stat
- [ ] Only push if explicitly requested and confirmed

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

❌ **Assume current directory:**
```bash
# BAD - Never assume you're in the right place
git status
```

❌ **Auto-push without confirmation:**
```bash
# BAD - Never push without explicit confirmation
git commit -m "message" && git push
```

❌ **Add Claude attribution:**
```bash
# BAD - Never add attribution
git commit -m "feat: add feature

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

❌ **Use git add with . or -A:**
```bash
# BAD - Never use blanket staging
git add .
git add -A
```

❌ **Stage sensitive files:**
```bash
# BAD - Never stage secrets or credentials
git add .env
git add config/credentials.json
git add *.key
git add *.pem
```

❌ **Skip security scanning of staged diff:**
```bash
# BAD - Never commit without scanning for secrets first
git add file.py
git commit -m "message"  # Without running git diff --cached and checking for secrets
```

❌ **Commit after detecting secrets:**
```bash
# BAD - If secrets detected, STOP immediately
# After git diff --cached shows API_KEY = "sk-..."
git commit -m "message"  # NEVER proceed if secrets found
```

❌ **Use git commit with -a flag blindly:**
```bash
# BAD - Stages everything including unintended files
git commit -am "message"
```

❌ **Chain push operations:**
```bash
# BAD - No automatic chaining to push
git commit -m "message" && git push
```

## Best Practices

✅ **Emit skill activation notice at the start of every operation**
✅ **Always show full paths in cd commands**
✅ **Review changes before staging**
✅ **ALWAYS stage specific files explicitly (never `git add .` or `git add -A`)**
✅ **Verify no .env or credential files are being staged**
✅ **Run security scan on staged diff (git diff --cached) - STOP if secrets detected**
✅ **Perform commit readiness evaluation (impact, testing, static analysis, problem, risk)**
✅ **Present evaluation to user and wait for confirmation**
✅ **Draft commit message with structured body for significant changes**
✅ **Include "Related:" section referencing TODO.md, PROBLEMS.md, Jira tickets**
✅ **Quantify impact when possible ("Time savings: 15+ minutes", "Accuracy: 97.1%")**
✅ **Use heredoc for multi-line commits**
✅ **Verify commit after creation**
✅ **Keep commits focused and atomic**
✅ **Separate unrelated changes into different commits**
✅ **For phased work, use "Phase N - " prefix in summary**
✅ **Use just repo-* commands for multi-repo operations**

## Integration with TODO.md

When making commits related to TODO.md tasks:

1. Reference the TODO item in commit message if helpful
2. Update TODO.md to mark tasks as DONE (with completion date)
3. Commit TODO.md changes immediately (per CLAUDE.md requirements)

Example workflow:
```bash
# Make code changes
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git add services/medical-agent/
git commit -m "feat(agents): add biomarker extraction validation"

# Update TODO.md
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta
# (edit TODO.md to mark task as DONE)
git add TODO.md
git commit -m "docs: mark biomarker validation task as DONE"
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Check Status Across All Repos

```bash
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta
just repo-status
```

Or manually:
```bash
echo "=== machina-meta ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta
git status --short

echo "=== repos/dem2 ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git status --short

echo "=== repos/dem2-webui ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-webui
git status --short

echo "=== repos/dem2-infra ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-infra
git status --short

echo "=== repos/medical-catalog ==="
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/medical-catalog
git status --short
```

### Scenario 2: Single File Change

```
NOTE: Using machina-git skill for this operation.
```

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to repo
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta

# Step 2: Review changes
git status
git diff CLAUDE.md

# Step 3: Stage specific file
git add CLAUDE.md

# Step 4: Security scan staged diff
git diff --cached
# Review output for any secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.
# If secrets detected: STOP and alert user

# Step 5: Evaluate commit readiness
# Present evaluation to user:
=== COMMIT READINESS EVALUATION ===

1. Impact/Value:
   ✅ Updates documentation for git workflow consistency
   Estimated Impact: MEDIUM
   Reasoning: Improves developer experience and prevents git errors

2. Testing Status:
   N/A - Documentation change
   Testing Status: N/A

3. Static Analysis:
   N/A - Markdown file
   Static Analysis: N/A

4. Problem Solved:
   Root cause: Git rules scattered across multiple sections
   Solution: Consolidate into unified "Git Rules" section for easier reference
   References: N/A

5. Risk Assessment:
   ✅ No code changes
   ✅ Documentation only
   Risk Level: LOW
   Mitigation: N/A

=== RECOMMENDATION: READY TO COMMIT ===

Does this evaluation look correct? Should I proceed with the commit?

# Step 6: Commit (after user confirmation)
git commit -m "docs: consolidate git rules into unified section"

# Step 7: Verify
git log -1 --stat

# Step 8: Ask about push
# Ask: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Files in Backend

```bash
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git status
git add services/medical-agent/src/machina/medical_agent/agents/medical_agent.py
git add services/medical-agent/src/machina/medical_agent/agents/config.yml
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
refactor(agents): improve error handling in medical agent

- Add try/catch blocks around tool execution
- Log errors with full context
- Return structured error responses to frontend
EOF
)"
git log -1 --stat
```

### Scenario 4: Preview Environment (multi-repo)

```bash
# Step 1: Tag backend
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2
git tag -f preview-my-feature
# Push tag (if confirmed): git push origin preview-my-feature --force

# Step 2: Tag frontend
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-webui
git tag -f preview-my-feature
# Push tag (if confirmed): git push origin preview-my-feature --force

# Step 3: Update infra
cd /home/dbeal/repos/NumberOne-AI/machina-meta/repos/dem2-infra
git checkout -b preview/my-feature
# Make changes, commit, push (if confirmed)
```

## Protected Push Operation

Git push is a **protected operation**. Never execute `git push` without:

1. Showing the commit(s) that will be pushed:
   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. Asking explicitly: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"

3. Waiting for user confirmation ("yes", "push", "push it")

4. Only then executing:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

For force pushes (tags, rewrites), extra caution:
```bash
# Show what will be force pushed
git show preview-my-feature

# Ask: "This is a force push. Should I proceed?"
# Only if confirmed:
git push origin preview-my-feature --force
```
